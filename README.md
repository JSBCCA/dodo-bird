# dodo-bird
A silly game I created for a class project.

Info:
You are playing as a falling Dodo Bird.
Avoid the green blocks to rack up points!
The dodo will fall faster and faster as time goes on, so be extra careful!
Hitting any green block will result in a Game Over, and then the game will reset, along with your point counter.
however, the game will always save your highest score for as long as the window remains open.
Challenge your friends to beat your highest score!

Hint:
Move left and right while between two green blocks to earn bonus points!
For every move between two blocks, you'll gain an extra point!
